## 1. Overview

# The Programme: [TITLE HERE]! 

**Features Overview** 

<!-- ## 2. User Experience (UX)

The [‘5 Planes of UX Design Model’ (5PUXD)](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05#:~:text=The%20five%20planes%20%E2%80%94%20strategy%2C%20scope,the%20problem%20as%20a%20whole) provides **five** core principles used when creating Programmes and applications.These principles are: 

- Strategy
- Scope
- Structure
- Skeleton
- Surface

The **Strategy** and **Scope** plane in the 5PUXD model suggest that consumer trends, needs and competing services should be considered before designing applications. Arguably, these factors are essential to identifying the core deliverables of the application and its services being offered. It also helps designers clarify the applications’ relevance withing the respective industry and potential market demand.
As such, brief market research was conducted to gain insight into competing services (e.g. ) and user psychographics. It also helped identify the target audience and the perceived objectives (goals) of the programme owner and users’ (first-time and re-occurring) who visit the programme. This is discussed in more detail below.

### **2.2 Competitor Analysis**

As part of competitor analysis, the following language applications were reviewed. Analysis of such applications assisted in the conceptualisation and creation of the Programme’s User Experience Deign. 

Below is a list of some of the Programmes and applications reviewed:

**2.2.2 Competitor Analysis**

### **2.3 Key Psychographic(s)**

### **2.4 Key Demographic(s)**

### **2.5 User stories: programme Owner and User goals**

#### **2.5.1 Goals: First-time user** 

#### **2.5.2 Goals: Re-occurring user** 


#### **2.5.3 Goals: programme Owner**  -->


## 3. Content

This section discusses various design elements of the programme. Formulating and executing such elements were integral the development of the programme. Arguably, consideration of these factors echoes the premises of the latter planes of the 5PUXD Model. For instance, when designing the programme, it was essential to identify the required information of the programme (structure) and how users can access this content (skeleton).

### **3.1 Logistics: Flow Chart** 

Creating the mock-ups of the programme helped to highlight the limitations and strengths and weakness of it's operation. It also allowed a more accurate analysis of which elements were feasible to execute within the project time frame and which could be implemented if the programme could be expanded on in further development.

### **5.3 Testing Applications** 

The following applications were used to test various aspects of theprogramme. Meeting these requirements were essential to the programme complying with accessibility, coding and performance standards within the programming industry.

-   [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/)
-   [(Jigsaw) Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)
-   [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
-   [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
-   [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/)
-   [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 **HTML, CSS and JS Validator Tests**

To ensure that the HTML, CSS and JS source-code adhered to industry standards, each were run through respective validators:

- [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [(Jigsaw) Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)
- [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com/). 

All the tests produced **_**. Evidence of the tests can be found in the testing repository directory, [here](docs/testing).

### **6.2 WAVE: Programme Accessibility Test**

The [WAVE Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org) was used to evaluate the overall accessibility of ____________programme. It considered factors such as the quantity and suitability of accessibility features used on the Programme (e.g. aria-labels, degree of contrast). The results produced **_**, thus passing the overall test. 

### **6.3 LIGHTHOUSE: Programme Performance test**

The [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#devtools) was used to test the performance of the _________________. In relation to performance, the tests indicated that the Programme would operate at an optimal level on desktop devices where each page achieved a score between **91-99 out of 100**. Evidence for the results of each page can be found [here](docs/testing/lighthouse-results).

### **6.4 Programme Responsiveness**

Regarding the Programme’s degree of responsiveness, the programme was accessed on multiple devices (incl. mobile, tablets, desktop, and larger devices) and multiple browsers (incl. FireFox, Google Chrome and Microsoft edge). The __________________ appears to respond appropriately to the changing device screen sizes and altering of browser’s size. Evidence of this is provided below:

## 7. Deployment

The __________________ Programme was deployed locally via the use of GitHub (web application), Git Bash, Python and an IDE such as VS Code (desktop application, and the use of a ‘repo’ - specific SSH Key. An overview of how the programme was deployed locally is discussed in more detail below: 


### 7.1 Deployment: Local Clone 

|The Process – Installing Python v3 and later| 
|-------------|
||

|The Process – Installing Python extension for IDE| 
|-------------|
|-----------|
|Notes on interpreter selection too|


|The Process – Local Clone| 
|-------------|
|Note: You will need this key to clone your repo to your local space (e.g. on your desktop).|
|1.	Download the GitBash application and create a SSH key. How to create a SSH key can be found [here]( https://inchoo.net/dev-talk/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-for-git-authorization/).|
|2.	Sign into [GitHub](https://github.com/).|
|3.	Click your profile icon in the top-right corner of the GitHub webpage, click **Settings**.|
|4.	Click SSH and GPG Keys tab on the left-hand menu.|
|5.	Click **‘New SSH Key’**, then copy and paste your key code (created via GitBash) into the box under the **’Key’** title.|
|6.	Click **’Add SSH Key’**., your key will then be ready to use!|
|7.	Click the **’+’** icon in the top-right icon on the web browser and select **‘New Repository’**. You will then be directed to a webpage titled ‘Create a new repository’.| 
|8	Fill out the required areas. Ensure the repository has been assigned a name and has a README.md created. The README file can be added by selecting the **'Add a README file'** option at the bottom of the ‘Create a new repository’ form.|
|9. Copy your SSH key from your repo. To do this:
|9.1 Open GitHub and navigate to the repo you want to clone.|
|9.2 Click the **’Code’** button in the top-right corner of your repo window.|
|9.3 Click the SSH Key tab.|
|9.4 Copy the SSH key via right click and copy or clicking the clipboard icon.|
|10. On your desktop, open VSCode.|
|11. On the taskbar at the top of tab, click the **File** tab.|
|12. Select the folder you want to clone your repo to.|
|13. In the terminal box, type **‘git clone’**.|
|14. Then copy your SSH key after the git clone command. Then press enter.|
|15. The terminal should present the pathway to your cloned repository. For instance, this “Ba Mi Soro!” project will display the following in the VSCode’s terminal:| 
|- **…C:\Users\missm\Documents\GIT\ba-mi-soro>**|
|16. Once cloned, you will be able to edit your repo locally and commit, pull and push changes to your online GitHub repo (remote repository) using terminal commands (e.g. 'git push', 'git add .' and 'git pull').| 

### 7.2 Deployment: GitHub Pages

Below is an overview on how to deploy a project via GitHub’s GitHub Pages. This method was used to deploy the “Ba Mi Soro!” Programme:

|The Process| 
|-------------|
| 1. Create a project **repository** on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using a registered GitHub account.|
|2. Once the repository is created, click on the repository, then the **Settings** tab, this is the last tab in the top right of the repository’s **navigation bar**.|
|3. Once on the settings page, navigate to and click on **Pages** (titled as ‘Pages’ as of May 2021) listed in the left-hand menu pane.|
|4. Under the header - **Source**, select **master branch**  from the drop-down list. This will change the neighbouring selector box to **/(root)**.|
|5. Then click **Save**.|
|6. Wait for a minute and then **refresh** the webpage.|
|7. Once refreshing, a green box with the text and clickable link; **'Your programme is published at...'**.| 
|8. Clicking on the Programme’s hyperlink in the green box will direct to the live deployedprogramme.|
